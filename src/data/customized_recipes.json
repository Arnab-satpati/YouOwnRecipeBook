    "description": "Sink your teeth into the ultimate indulgence \u2014 the Hot Burger, our signature lunchtime masterpiece. This beast begins with a thick, juicy beef patty, flame-grilled to perfection, locking in all the smoky flavors you'd expect from a premium grillhouse. It\u2019s smothered in two layers of melted sharp cheddar that oozes over the edges, paired with caramelized onions that add a touch of sweetness to the savory profile.\n\nCrisp, shredded lettuce adds a refreshing crunch, balanced by thin-sliced tomatoes, tangy pickles, and a slather of our house-blend smoky chipotle aioli. All this sits between two buttery, toasted brioche buns that are soft yet firm enough to hold the glory together. Each bite hits a wave of heat, juiciness, and texture that makes you stop, close your eyes, and say, \u201cDamn, this is next level.\u201d\n\nServed best with thick-cut fries and an ice-cold cola on the side. It\u2019s not just a burger \u2014 it\u2019s a bold, unforgettable experience in your mouth.",
